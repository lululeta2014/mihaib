QUnit JavaScript unit tests

Write simple, independent tests as separate .html files (each may alter the DOM
or change global state). Then make one ‘composite’ file which simply references
all of them. Loading this file runs all the tests.

This compositing can be done on multiple levels:
― Each subproject can have several independent tests and one test runner which
references all of them. E.g. nested-test/ is a subproject with 2 simple
test suites and 1 runner which references them.
― A project's test runner can reference the composite test runner from each
of its subprojects. E.g. on the top level we have /test-runner.html which
references the runner in the nested-test/ subproject and also the simple
top-level /test1.html.

Load these ‘test runners’ from a webserver, not using the file:// protocol.
