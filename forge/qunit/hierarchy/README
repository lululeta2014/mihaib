Write simple, independent tests as separate .html files (which may alter the
DOM or change global state). Then reference them all from one ‘master’ file
which runs all of them, using jquery-composite.
This ‘compositing’ may be hierarchical, as shown in the example below.

Load these ‘test runners’ from a webserver, not using the file:// protocol.

master.html	Runs all tests, by including test-autostart.html,
		test-no-autostart.html and nested/master.html.
test-autostart.html	Simple test suite
test-no-autostart.html	Registers its tests later, so disables QUnit autostart
			for ‘compositing’ (see ../basic/no-auto-start.html)
nested/		A subproject, with its own individual tests and ‘master’ runner
nested/master.html	Runs all tests for the subproject, by referencing
			test-autostart.html and test-no-autostart.html
nested/test-autostart.html	Simple test suite
nested/test-no-autostart.html	Registers tests later, disables QUnit autostart
