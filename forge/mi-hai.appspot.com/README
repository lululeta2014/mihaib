Simple Google Appengine Go App
It's made up of independent sections, each under its own /path/.
Some sections have only static files, others also have server-side (app) code.

It looks like we should use full paths for all imports (github.com/â€¦),
both packages inside this app and external ones,
and deploying to appengine deploys what you have in your local $GOPATH.

Format, Build and Run any unit tests:
./build.sh

To run in dev:
$APPENG_GO/goapp serve app/
http://localhost:8080/

To deploy:
Using -A and -V override the app id and version from app/app.yaml:
$APPENG_GO/appcfg.py update --no_cookies -A mi-hai -V 1 -e your_email app/
