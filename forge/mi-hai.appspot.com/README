It's made up of independent sections, each under its own /path/.
Some sections have only static files, others also have server-side (app) code.

To run in dev:
$APPENG_GO/goapp serve app/
http://localhost:8080/

To deploy:
Using -A and -V override the app id and version from app/app.yaml:
$APPENG_GO/appcfg.py update --no_cookies -A mi-hai -V 1 -e your_email app/
