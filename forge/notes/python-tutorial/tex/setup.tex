\section{Setup}

\subsection{Interpreter}

\verb=python -c command [arg] ...= executes the statements in \emph{command}.\\
\verb=python -m module [arg] ...= executes the source file for \emph{module}.\\
To run a script and enter interactive mode afterwards,
pass \verb=-i= before the script.

\verb=sys.argv= has length at least 1.
When no script and no args are given, \verb=sys.argv[0]= is an empty string.
When the script name is given as \verb='-'= (meaning standard input),
\verb=sys.argv[0]= is set to \verb='-'=.
When \verb=-c command= is used, \verb=sys.argv[0]= is set to \verb='-c'=.
When \verb=-m module= is used,
\verb=sys.argv[0]= is set to the full name of the located module.
Additional options are left in \verb=sys.argv=
for the command or module to handle.

\subsection{Executable scripts}
