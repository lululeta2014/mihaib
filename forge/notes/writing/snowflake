How to write a novel using the snowflake method

Good fiction is designed. You can design before or after writing, the author suggests to design first, following a guiding principle early on.
You've spent a long time thinking about the story before you start writing. You must fill in the holes in it.
– write a one sentece summary of your novel (1 hour)
– expand it into a full paragraph (1 hour). Describe setups, disasters and ending. E.g. 3 disasters; as he tries to fix things he causes more disasters.
– do the same for your characters: name, one sentence summary of story, motivation (abstract desire), goal (concrete desire), conflict, epiphany (what does he learn / how does he change), 1 paragraph summary
– expand each sentence into a paragraph
– write descriptions for each character (not only the main ones) then tell the story from their perspective
– again, expand sentences into paragraphs
– expand character descriptions into larger charts with lots of details. They should start to drive the story. Pay attention to how they're changed / what they learn.
– Make a list of scenes from your draft. For each, list which is the POV character and what happens.
– expand each scene to a multi-paragraph description; list cool dialogue, sketch out essential conflict; if no conflict, add some or delete the scene.
