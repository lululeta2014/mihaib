If we bind the field of an outer polymer element to the attribute of an inner
polymer element, and the inner element has a getter/setter, it doesn't work
properly anymore (the getter & setter don't run).

Maybe the inner element is now using the field from the outer element's model?
I don't know.

But if the inner element has a normal field and a myFieldChanged(),
the *Changed() still fires and things work as expected.
This is probably “the Polymer way”.
