Currently (Mar 2014) templates seem to be continuously re-rendered.
Even if they weren't, we have X, Y, product(=X×Y) and a ‘whatever’ field
(i.e. many other ‘whatever’ fields that the user keeps editing in a large app).
We shouldn't re-compute the product every time we change unrelated fields
and render the template.

Test an expensive computation on every template rendering or,
with more effort, only when its dependencies change.
