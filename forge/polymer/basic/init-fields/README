Check if the *Changed() watchers run for the initial values of properties,
depending on how we initialize the elements.
But this probably isn't “polymeric”.
We could create elements where the default values for computed and non-computed
fields alike are something like empty strings, so it doesn't matter if the
*Changed() watchers run on initialization or not.
