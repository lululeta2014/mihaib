A simple control for First Name & Last Name ⇒ computed Full Name.
We assume all operations are expensive (even if for this particular element
they're only trimming and concatenating strings) and we're trying to find
a polymer design to only compute something when its dependencies change.

Specification:
This element has the following properties (those marked with star* are also
exposed as attributes):
first*, last*, full

The element formats & sanitizes the name (adjust whitespace, upper/lowercase,
etc. as defined below).
‘First’ and ‘last’ may be set when the item is created and may also be
written to later. They auto-sanitize themselves.

‘Full’ is ‘first + ' ' + last’, without leading or trailing whitespace (either
‘first’ or ‘last’ may be empty). Trying to write it throws an exception.

Sanitizing is:
Removing leading and trailing whitespace.
Converting on or more whitespace chars to a single space.

Note: because we're using getters and setters, binding the attributes of this
element to properties of a parent element's model won't work
(see ../../basic/nested-bind/ for an example of this issue).
