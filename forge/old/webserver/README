Simple HTTP file server

$ ant run
Starts the webserver serving from ./wwwroot

Point your browser to:
http://localhost:8000/file.html
http://localhost:8000/hello.txt

Close with Ctrl-C.


Implements only GET requests.
Doesn't generate directory listings
(you must type the full path to a file, works for UTF-8 filenames).
.html, .txt files open in your browser.
For other files (e.g. .css) your browser should show a download window.
To open (not download) files with other extensions, add them to the config file.
Change the listen port (default 8000) in the config file.
