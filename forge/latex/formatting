Non-breaking spaces use the ‘~’ symbol.
Phillip~J.~Fry,
50~€.
‘\ ’ → a space that will not be enlarged.

Quotes
`quote' → ‘quote’
``quote'' → “quote”

One way to avoid long words beyond the right margin is to place the paragraph
in \begin{sloppyvar}…\end{sloppyvar}.

Slash marks
Use ‘input\slash output’ to allow a line break after the ‘/’. Only use the ‘/’
in units, e.g. ‘mm/year’, which should not be broken.

Superscript, subscript
March 6\textsuperscript{th}
\usepackage{fixltx2e}	% to add subscript support
Sub\textsubscript{script}

Dashes
- → hyphen, -- → en-dash, --- → em-dash, $-1$ minus sign in math formula.
Ellipsis: \ldots or \textellipsis (so spacing between the dots can vary?)
\today, \TeX, \LaTeX, etc.

Paragraph alignment
Justified by default.
Environments: flushleft, flushright, center.
Equivalent commands: \raggedright, \raggedleft, \centering.
There's no explicit way to justify text, so if you use the commands outside
of a group they'll affect the rest of the document.

Manual breaks
\newline, \\, \\* (prohibits a page break after this forced line break).

Verbatim text
In the ‘verbatim’ environment, all spaces and new lines are reproduced and
LaTeX commands are ignored.
See also the ‘alltt’ package and environment.
For a short verbatim phrase, the \verb command, \verb+my text+, can use any
delimiter (here ‘+’) except ‘*’.
See also the fancyvrb package and its Verbatim environment.
The moreverb package adds \begin{listing}[step]{first line}.
First line is the line number of the first line, step is how often to show
line numbers.

URLs: the hyperref or url packages provide the \url command

Environments for Quoting Text: quote, quotation, verse.

Emphasizing text:
I want to \emph{emphasize} a word.
\emph{In this emphasized sentence, there is an emphasized \emph{word}
which looks upright.}

\textnormal{document font family}
\emph{emphasis}
\textrm{roman font family}
\textsf{sans serif font family}
\texttt{teletypefont family}
\textup{upright shape}
\textit{italic shape}
\textsl{slanted shape}
\textsc{Small Capitals}
\uppercase and \lowercase, but they have caveats.
\textbf{bold}
\textmd{medium weight}

Avoid \underline, bad typography, the text won't break properly,
and complications with the ‘ulem’ package which takes over \emph.

Some font styles are incompatible with each other; extra packages help.
For bold small capitals use:
\usepackage{bold-extra}
\textsc{ \textbf{This is bold small capitals} }

Font sizes:
\tiny
\scriptsize
\footnotesize
\small
\normalsize
\large
\Large
\LARGE
\huge
\Huge

Use as: {\Large some words}

To use any font installed on the system in XeTeX:
\usepackage{fontspec}
