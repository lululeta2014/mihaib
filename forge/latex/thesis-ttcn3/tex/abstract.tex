This paper presents a solution for
adding Java unit testing functionality to \ac{TTCN-3} test systems.
This is of particular interest in two situations:
when testing a remote system by using a communication library
--- and the methods invoked perform communication operations;
when a system's internal state must be examined or changed
while performing black box (message based) testing.

Unit tests written in general purpose programming languages
can not easily handle network behavior such as timeouts,
asynchronous communication or pattern matching for received data.
\ac{TTCN-3} is a standardized language specifically designed for
the needs of testing entities which communicate by exchanging messages.

This project provides a translation layer
allowing the use of a \ac{TTCN-3} test system
for Java unit testing.
This project also serves as a proof of concept,
extending the applicability of \ac{TTCN-3} technology
to the area of unit testing,
since it allows any Java code to be tested
(not only code performing communication).
