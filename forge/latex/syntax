Spaces are normalized: multiple spaces and tabs, or a single line break,
are treated as one space.
An empty line (or several) ends a paragraph.

Reserved characters:
# $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \
To enter them in text, escape them:
\# \$ \% \^{} \& \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash{}

The sequence ‘\\’ is used for line breaking. Use \backslash in math mode.
The commands \~ and \^ would place the diacritic over the next letter,
e.g. \~n → ñ.
You can also use \textasciitilde and \textasciicircum.
If ‘<’ and ‘>’ don't print properly, use \textless and \textgreater.

Group: defined by a pair of braces. The range of commands between them
is limited to them. The \begingroup and \endgroup commands are equivalent to
opening and closing brace. Example:
{
\bf This is bold.
}
This is no longer bold.

Environment: similar to commands, can contain commands and nested environments.
Internally, it defines a group, so its usage is safe
(doesn't influence other parts of the document).
\begin{environmentname}
text to be influenced
\end{environmentname}

Commands: case sensitive, two formats:
― Start with backslash \ and have a name consisting of letters only.
The command name is terminated by a space or any other non-letter.
― A backslash \ and exactly one non-letter.

Some commands need an argument, given between curly braces {}
after the command name. Some commands have optional parameters, given between
square brackets [] after the command name.
\commandname[option1,option2,…]{argument1}{argument2}…

Most standard LaTeX commands have a ‘switch’ equivalent.
Switches have no arguments but apply on the rest of the scope,
i.e. the current group or environment.
A switch should almost never be called outside of any scope,
otherwise it will apply on the rest of the document.

% \emph is a command with argument, \em is a switch.
\emph{emphasized text}, this part is normal
{\em emphasized text}, this part is normal

Comments
‘%’, the rest of the line, the line break, and all leading whitespace
on the next line.
See package verbatim and \begin{comment} for multi-line comments.
