Transfer files between two computers

Please use the Java implementation, it is the best one.

Run the same program on both computers:
- in 'server mode' (listening on a port) on one computer
- in 'client mode' (connecting to the first computer's IP and port) on another

Run whoever wants to send files (the server or the client)
with the files as command line arguments.
