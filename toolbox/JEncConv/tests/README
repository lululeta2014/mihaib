Run texttest from this directory

“TextTest only collates files created or modified by the test run.”

Seems that “modified” means “whose timestamp has changed”.
This behavior is bad for some tests (eg Overwrite\ExistingBakFileForce).
Here's why:

– After git clone, all files (f2, f2.bak etc.) have the same timestamp
– They're all copied to the sandbox and the test is run
– The test renames f2 to f2.bak; because f2 had the same timestamp as f2.bak,
texttest thinks that f2.bak hasn't been changed (and doesn't collate it).

A workaround is to ‘touch f2’ to ensure different timestamp from f2.bak.
(same for f4).
