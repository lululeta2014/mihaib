Generate PDF and EPUB books from a simple plain text format

Thanks go out to Paul Salvette for his excellent EPUB tutorial & example:

Your book source must be in a single directory with the following format:
– A file named cover.jpg
– A file named ‘title’ with metadata in JSON, e.g.:
{
  "title": "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland",
  "author": "Lewis Carroll"
}
Run the program with ‘--help’ to see all fields allowed in the ‘title’ file.
– All other files, in lexicographical order, are chapters in the book,
and have the following format: the first line of the file is the chapter title,
and every subsequent line is a paragraph in the book.
The file names are ignored so you may use any ordering scheme e.g.:
[‘1.down-the-rabbit-hole’, ‘2.the-pool-of-tears’] or [‘chapter1’, ‘chapter2’].
